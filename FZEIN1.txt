<div class='one two' id='bot'>AJAX is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications. If you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML, then you need to spend just one hour to start with AJAX.</div>
<br />
<h5 class='one two' id='bot'>Why to Learn Ajax?</h5><br />

<p class='one two' id='bot'>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.</p>
<ul class='list-group one two' id='bot'></ul>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from the server in the background.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Intuitive and natural user interaction. Clicking is not required, mouse movement is a sufficient event trigger.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Data-driven as opposed to page-driven.</li>
<br />
<h5 class='one two' id='bot'>Rich Internet Application Technology</h5><br />

<div class='one two' id='bot'>AJAX is the most viable Rich Internet Application (RIA) technology so far. It is getting tremendous industry momentum and several tool kit and frameworks are emerging. But at the same time, AJAX has browser incompatibility and it is supported by JavaScript, which is hard to maintain and debug.</div>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Browser-based presentation using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Data is stored in XML format and fetched from the server.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>Behind-the-scenes data fetches using XMLHttpRequest objects in the browser.</li>
<li class='list-group-item one two' id='bot'>JavaScript to make everything happen.</li>
<br />
<h5 class='one two' id='bot'>Prerequisites</h5><br />

<p class='one two alert alert-warning' id='bot'>It is highly recommended that you are familiar with HTML and JavaScript before attempting this tutorial.</p>
<p class='one two alert alert-warning' id='bot'>AJAX cannot work independently. It is used in combination with other technologies to create interactive webpages.</p>
<h6 class='one two ' id='bot'>JavaScript</h6><br />

<li class='list-gro em one two ' id='bot'>Loosely typed scripting language.JavaScript function is called when an event occurs in a page.Glue for the whole AJAX operation.</li>
<h6 class='one two ' id='bot'>DOM</h6>
<p class='one two ' id='bot'>API for accessing and manipulating structured documents.Represents the structure of XML and HTML documents.</p>
<h6 class='one two ' id='bot'>CSS</h6>
<p class='one two ' id='bot'>Allows for a clear separation of the presentation style from the content and may be changed programmatically by JavaScript</p>
<h6 class='one two ' id='bot'>XMLHttpRequest</h6>
<p class='one two ' id='bot'>JavaScript object that performs asynchronous interaction with the server.</p>
