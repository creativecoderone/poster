<div class='one two' id='bot'>Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world</div>
<br />
<h5 class='one two' id='bot'>Prerequisites</h5>
<div class='one two' id='bot'>Before proceeding with this , you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript. As we are going to develop web-based applications using Node.js, it will be good if you have some understanding of other web technologies such as HTML, CSS, AJAX, etc.</div>

<h5 class='one two' id='bot'>What is Node.js?</h5>
<div class='one two' id='bot'>Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and its latest version is v0.10.36.</div><br />
<p class='one two alert alert-dark' id='bot'>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p><br />
<div class='one two ' id='bot'>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.</div>
<div class='one two ' id='bot'>Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.</div>
<p class='one two alert alert-dark' id='bot'>Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library</p>

<h5 class='one two al t-dark' id='bot'>Features of Node.js</h5>
<h6 class='one two alet lert-dark' id='bot'>Asynchronous and Event Driven</h6>
<p class='one two alert alert-info' id='bot'>All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.</p>
 <h6 class='one two a' id='bot'>Very Fast</h6>
<p class='one two alert alert-info' id='bot'>Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.</p>
<h6 class='one two alrt alert-inf' id='bot'>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable</h6>
<p class='one two alert alert-info' id='bot'>Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.</p>
